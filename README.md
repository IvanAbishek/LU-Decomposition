# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. import numpy as np
2. from scipy package import lu
3. get input fromt the user
4. print result

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix
